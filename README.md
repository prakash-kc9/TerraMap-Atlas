TerraMap: A Global Atlas
Owner: Prakash Choudhary

TerraMap is a web application designed to be a comprehensive and intuitive atlas for exploring countries. Built with a focus on clean design and efficient data fetching, it provides users with key information about every country in the world in a single, responsive interface.

The project demonstrates my ability to build a robust, data-driven application from the ground up, handle asynchronous data, and create a user-friendly interface using modern React best practices.

Features
Comprehensive Data Display: View a country's population, capital, languages, currencies, and more.

Search & Filter: Easily find countries by name or filter by region.

Dynamic Routing: Seamlessly navigate to a detailed view for each country.

Responsive Layout: The application is fully responsive and optimized for a consistent experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Core Technologies
React: The application is built using React to manage state and create a component-based architecture.

React Router: Handles client-side routing for dynamic and efficient page navigation.

Axios: Manages API calls to the REST Countries API for data fetching.

CSS: All styling is done with modern CSS, focusing on a clean, minimal design and responsive layouts.

Future Scope
While this project is a complete and functional application, a few key areas have been identified for potential future development to enhance the user experience and demonstrate more advanced skills:

Performance Optimization: Implement state management (e.g., Redux, Zustand) to reduce prop drilling and manage global state more efficiently.

User Interface Enhancements: Integrate a dark/light mode toggle for accessibility and user preference.

Advanced Data Visualization: Add interactive charts and graphs to visualize demographic data such as population growth over time.

Extended Functionality: Implement a feature to display a country's neighboring countries and allow for easy navigation between them.
